# # About Cyan Planet

Cyan Planet pioneers the use of immersive media like virtual reality to evoke empathy for life in the ocean and spark action in support of marine conservation.
Cyan Planet is a social enterprise founded in 2019 in Germany and a non-profit incorporated in the US. We use the power of virtual reality and immersive media to inspire, educate about the science of marine ecosystems, and to create a global community that acts for marine conservation. Our immersive projects reconnect humanity with nature and ultimately solve the human’s alienation of nature that led to its destruction and unsustainable exploitation through humans.
